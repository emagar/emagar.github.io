<p>
The longitudinal analysis of elections is richer when socio-demographic controls are included, such as voting age population or the share of indigenous language speakers in a unit. A key source of aggregate data is the census. Yet the mismatch between decennial censuses and the three-year election cycle is an obstacle. The census bureau fills the gap partially, distributing annual municipal projections of selected indicators only (excluding voting age population, see <a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/ccpv/cpvsh/doc/serie_censal_intercensal_1990_2010.pdf">this</a> for detail).  
</p>

<p>
Systematic analysis of municipalities large and small (N &asymp; 2500), of less common units like federal or state electoral districts, or of much more disaggregated units like secciones electorales (N &asymp; 67k) necessitates self-estimation of off-census socio-demographic indicators from official data. This note discusses one approach to achieve this.

<p>
The problem, for illustrative purposes, is obtaining sección-level voting age populations for triennial federal elections from 1994 to 2021. In the period, INEGI distributes population counts for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 (General Censuses) and mid-decade counts in 1995 and 2005.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> 
From here on, I use the term census to refer to counts and censuses indistinctly. 
</p>

<p>
I proceed with inter- and extra-polation to project socio-demographic indicators for non-census years from the census/conteo figures available. Three approaches are inspected here: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Line <b>segments</b> connecting each unit's contiguous pair of census points;</li>
<li>A <b>linear</b> regression of census points for the unit on time; and</li>
<li>A <b>log-linear</b> regression of the (log-transformed) points on time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A further obstacle is that the census bureau began distribution of sección-level census aggregates only in 2005.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Whereas five census points are available for municipalities (1995 2000 2005 2010 2020), there are only three for secciones (2005 2010 2020).

<h2 id="org815849c"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> The segments model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Formally, letting \(T_1, T_2, \dots\) be contiguous census years, a given unit's population in year \(t\) in the segment model is:
</p>

<p>
\[\text{pop}_t = \text{pop}_{T_1} + \frac{\text{pop}_{T_2} - \text{pop}_{T_1}}{T_2 - T_1} \times (t - T_1) \forall t \in (T_1,T_2)\] 
</p>

<p>
\[\text{pop}_t = \text{pop}_{T_2} + \frac{\text{pop}_{T_3} - \text{pop}_{T_2}}{T_3 - T_2} \times (t - T_2) \forall t \in (T_2,T_3)\] 
</p>


<p>
\[\text{pop}_t = \left\{
     & \text{pop}_{T_1} + \frac{\text{pop}_{T_2} - \text{pop}_{T_1}}{T_2 - T_1} \times (t - T_1) \forall t \in (T_1,T_2) \\
     & \text{pop}_{T_2} + \frac{\text{pop}_{T_3} - \text{pop}_{T_2}}{T_3 - T_2} \times (t - T_2) \forall t \in (T_2,T_3)

Figure <a href="#org208b1b2">1</a> below illustrates segments projection with two municipalities in the northern state of Coahuila. Progreso municipality had nearly flat voting-age population growth in the period. Pay attention to circles in the plot only, black is for census values, white for projections. Fitting separate linear segments for each inter-census period accommodates changing trends of demographic change: a slight dip is visible between 1995 and 2010. Ramos Arizpe municipality is very different, with a sharp and accelerating surge in voting age population in the same period.

INEGI replaced mid-decade `conteos' with a sample in 2015. Conteos Generales in 1995 and 2005 were a mini census, with a basic questionnaire excluding most items used in general censuses and with limited effort to re-interview non-responders. An opinion poll method was used instead in 2015, much cheaper yet hardly comparable.

Roberto Ponce (CITE) attempted to reconstruct pre-2005 sección-level census data. The challenge is matching localidades (in rural Mexico) and manzanas (in urban Mexico), which INEGI has used as census tracts, to secciones electorales nationwide. Geo-referenced units open room to spot overlaps towards such match. It is worth revising this, he may have data.
