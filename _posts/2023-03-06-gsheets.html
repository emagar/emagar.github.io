<p>
To view/inspect/manipulate/save the data in google sheets, you must log into a google account. Start by doing this, then click the desired file's link below. A google spreadsheet will open in your browser. In order to inspect the data (eg. re-sorting rows by state or year), manipulate it according to your needs (eg. keeping a subset of the observations only), or saving the file to your hard drive, you must first type CTRL+A (ie., select all) then CTRL+SHIFT+V (ie., paste values only) &#x2014; this will unlink the data from the repository.
