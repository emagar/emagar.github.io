You’ll find this post in your `<sub>posts</sub>` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
</p>

<p>
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `<sub>posts</sub>` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="linenr">20: </span><span style="color: #008AFF;">;; </span><span style="color: #008AFF;">this will export with line number 20</span>
<span class="linenr">21: </span>(message <span style="color: #42D915;">"This is line 21"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-r">dat &lt;- read.csv(file ="file.csv")
head(dat)
</pre>
</div>
